# 🎯 Quick Guide: Create Project Board

The project board needs to be created. Here's the fastest way to do it:

## ✅ Step-by-Step: Create Project Board via Web Interface

1. **Go to the Projects page:**
   - Visit: https://github.com/benmed00/research-platform/projects

2. **Click "+ New project"** (green button on the right side)

3. **Choose project type:**
   - Select **"Board"** (Kanban-style board)

4. **Name your project:**
   - Title: `Research Platform Development`
   - (Optional) Description: `Strategic project board for Research Platform development, organized by milestones and features`

5. **Click "Create"**

6. **The board will open** - you can now configure it!

## 🔧 Configure Your Board (After Creation)

### Step 1: Add Columns

Click "Add column" and create these columns:
- 📋 **Backlog** - Ideas and future work
- 🎯 **To Do** - Planned and ready to start  
- 🚧 **In Progress** - Currently being worked on
- 👀 **Review** - Code review and testing
- ✅ **Done** - Completed work

### Step 2: Create Views (Optional but Recommended)

Click "View all" → "New view" to create:

1. **By Milestone View:**
   - Group by: Milestone
   - This will show issues organized by v1.0, v1.1, v1.2, v1.3, v2.0

2. **By Status View:**
   - Use the default Kanban board
   - Shows workflow progress

3. **By Priority View:**
   - Group by: Label (if you use priority labels)
   - Or create a custom field for priority

### Step 3: Link to Repository (Should be automatic)

If the project isn't automatically linked:
1. Click the project settings (gear icon)
2. Under "Linked repositories", add `research-platform`

## 🎉 Done!

Once created, your project board will appear at:
https://github.com/benmed00/research-platform/projects

You can then start adding issues and organizing them by milestone!
