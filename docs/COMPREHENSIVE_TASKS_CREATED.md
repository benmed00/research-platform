## ✅ Already Completed (Not Created as Issues)

Based on IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md, these are already done:
- ✅ All 10 core modules implemented
- ✅ CRUD operations complete
- ✅ Export PDF/Excel functionality
- ✅ Leaflet integration (basic)
- ✅ Dark mode
- ✅ Advanced search
- ✅ Filters and sorting
- ✅ Charts with Recharts

## 🎯 Next Steps

### 1. Organize Tasks in Project Board

Distribute tasks across columns:

**Todo:**
- Error handling standardization
- Performance benchmarking
- HTTP caching tasks (equipment, RH, species, environment, missions)
- Server-side pagination tasks
- Export functionality tasks
- Advanced filters

**Backlog:**
- Charts and analytics
- Import functionality
- v1.2 features (email, drag-drop, enhanced GIS)
- v1.3 features (testing, monitoring, i18n, accessibility)

**In Progress:**
- Move tasks here as work begins

**Done:**
- Mark tasks complete as they're finished

### 2. Link Existing Issues

The 9 tasks already in Todo should remain. Consider organizing by priority.

### 3. Create Views

- **By Milestone View**: Group by v1.0, v1.1, v1.2, v1.3
- **By Priority View**: Group by priority labels
- **By Module View**: Group by module labels
- **By Status View**: Current Kanban board
